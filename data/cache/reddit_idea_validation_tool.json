        "content": "On the 15th of December last year, my friend of 20+ years randomly stopped replying to me. We would play very consistently together and would have general chats a lot too. We were close, I helped him through a breakup earlier that year and he did the same for me. Needless to say I got a little upset and I can't defend myself for that. It would hurt because he would always be online, just... not opening our chats or even acknowledging them at all. \n\nI started to worry as the weeks went on. So many things were going through my head as to what could have been going on with him. I knew his brother was suicidal and going through some rough stuff, so god forbid anything had happened to him, thus I was worried for my friend even more. What if something terrible had happened? I started to look through obituaries stressing I'd find one of his family members there... I get that I spiralled a little. Bottom line, I was really worried.\n\nEventually, I messaged one of our old friends from school (my old friend, his current friend as we didn't talk after school) and to my disbelief, he mentioned that he talks to him fairly regularly. I would like to add that before I messaged this mutual friend, all my WhatsApp messages had been left unopened... since December of last year. The next day, I find that Andrew had opened my WhatsApp messaged but STILL didn't respond. I was at a loss for words.\n\nEventually I messaged him on Facebook as a last ditch effort, just copy and pasted my last message on WhatsApp and he read it, but still nothing. \n\nI don't understand why he's not getting back to me, genuienly everything was fine and we'd be kicking it back most nights gaming and having a great time.\n\nIf I'm such an issue, why not just block me? Why keep me here, catastrophising thinking something horrible has happened, and leaving me on unopened.\n\n",
