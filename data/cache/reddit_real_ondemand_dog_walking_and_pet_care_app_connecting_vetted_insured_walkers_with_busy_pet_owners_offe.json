        "content": "I'm looking for safe, reliable daycares for my five year old, gentle australian shepherd. Alternatively, looking for a walking service that offers a long playgroup (3+ hours) or something similar. I'm starting work remotely but then will start going into the office 3x a week, and I don't really want to just use walkers - my dog isn't used to being alone for long periods of time, and want to start using a service immediately while remote to ease him into the transition. Or do people find that using one or two reliable Rover walkers/daycare people are better?",

        "content": "Hey fellow dog owners! I’m looking for recommendations for a reliable and safe doggy daycare/boarding option that serves Manhattan. I live in Chelsea and have a 55lb lab mix who loves to play and has lots of energy. We used to go to Paws and Chelsea for over 1.5 years, but unfortunately, my dog was bitten unprovoked by another dog and had to get 4 stitches. It was really traumatizing, and I’m hesitant to go back there.",

        "content": "I’ve also tried Biscuit and Bath. While I like the Chelsea location, it mainly caters to small dogs, so my dog would always get separated because he was one of the larger, high-energy dogs, and they don’t have much space for him to run around. The Flatiron location is more spacious, but it’s quite expensive, and I’m worried they’ll eventually isolate him again since most of the dogs there are small too.",

We are currently training through some leash reactivity to other dogs and mild separation anxiety. Without knowing how much progress he'll make by November, and knowing that he does seem anxious around other dogs, I'm weary to use a traditional boarding facility or a service like Rover.",
