  const prompt = `You are a strategic business analyst with access to current market information. Analyze the unique value zone and competitive differentiation for this startup idea:

STARTUP IDEA: "${oneLiner}"
TARGET AUDIENCE: "${targetAudience}"
PROBLEM SOLVED: "${problemSolved}"

Research and analyze:
1. UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION: What makes this solution uniquely valuable?
2. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES: Search for current competitors and identify gaps this startup could exploit
3. MARKET POSITIONING: How should this startup position itself differently?
4. DIFFERENTIATION OPPORTUNITIES: What specific advantages could this startup develop?
5. TIMING ADVANTAGES: Are there current market conditions that favor this approach?

For each competitive advantage, research:
- Current solutions and their limitations
- User complaints about existing alternatives  
- Technological or business model opportunities
- Barriers competitors would face copying this approach

Also identify:
- Market gaps that aren't being addressed
- Weaknesses in current market leaders
- Opportunities for better user experience
- Potential risks to uniqueness

UNIQUENESS SCORING (0-100):
Evaluate uniqueness based on:
- Market differentiation: How different is this from existing solutions?
- Competitive barriers: How hard would this be for others to copy?
- Value proposition: Does the differentiation create meaningful value?
- Market timing: Is this uniqueness relevant to current market needs?
- Implementation difficulty: Technical or business model innovations

Consider both the innovation level and market viability. Revolutionary technology in a tiny market may score lower than modest innovation in a large market. Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
