STARTUP IDEA: "${oneLiner}"
TARGET AUDIENCE: "${targetAudience}"
PROBLEM SOLVED: "${problemSolved}"

Search the web to find:
1. DIRECT COMPETITORS: Companies solving the exact same problem for the same audience
2. INDIRECT COMPETITORS: Companies solving similar problems or serving the same audience differently
3. SUBSTITUTE SOLUTIONS: Current alternatives people use instead

For each competitor, research:
- Company name and what they do
- Funding status and company size
- Common user complaints (from reviews, forums, social media)
- Their main strengths and weaknesses
- Pricing model if available
- Market position

Also identify:
- Market gaps and unmet needs
- Opportunities for differentiation
- Overall competitive landscape assessment

IMPORTANT: Search for CURRENT information and provide REAL companies that exist today. Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
