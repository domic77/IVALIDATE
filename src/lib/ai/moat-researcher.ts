  const prompt = `You are a strategic business analyst with expertise in competitive moats and defensibility. Analyze the potential competitive moat and defensibility for this startup idea:

STARTUP IDEA: "${oneLiner}"
TARGET AUDIENCE: "${targetAudience}"
PROBLEM SOLVED: "${problemSolved}"

Research and analyze:
1. DEFENSIBILITY FACTORS: What competitive advantages could this business build?
2. BARRIERS TO ENTRY: What would make it hard for competitors to replicate?
3. NETWORK EFFECTS: Does this business have network effect potential?
4. SWITCHING COSTS: How sticky could this solution be for users?
5. FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGES: What advantages come from being early?
6. COMPETITIVE THREATS: What are the biggest risks to defensibility?

For each defensibility factor, analyze:
- Network effects potential (direct, indirect, data network effects)
- Switching costs (data lock-in, learning curve, integration complexity)
- Economies of scale opportunities
- Brand and trust advantages
- Regulatory or compliance barriers
- Technology or patent potential
- Data advantages and accumulation

Also identify:
- Time and cost barriers for competitors to build similar solutions
- Strategic moat-building sequence and timeline
- Key milestones that strengthen competitive position
- Vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies

MOAT SCORING (0-100):
- 80-100: Exceptional (Strong network effects, regulatory moats, patents)
- 60-79: Strong (Data advantages, high switching costs, brand moats)
- 40-59: Moderate (Some defensibility, moderate barriers to entry)
- 25-39: Weak (Basic differentiation, low switching costs)
- 10-24: Minimal (Easy to replicate, commodity-like)
- 0-9: None (No defensibility, pure commodity)

BENCHMARKS:
- Meta: 95 (Network effects + data)
- Salesforce: 75 (Switching costs + integration)
- Stripe: 70 (Integration + brand trust)
- Uber: 45 (Network effects offset by competition)
- Most SaaS: 40-60 (Some stickiness but replicable)
- Generic app: 15-25 (Easy to copy)

IMPORTANT: Most viable software businesses have 40-60 point moats. Score based on realistic defensibility. Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
